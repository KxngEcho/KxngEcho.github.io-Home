**Digital Craftsman (Developer/Filmaker/Creator)'**

I'm an indie Full-Stack Developer and content creator building my version of
the digital world one step at a time. All coding projects are built from the 
ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life
promblems with code. All video content is built the same way, from ideation
and planning, all the way to finalizing the content with artistic touches. I
publish that content on my YouTube channel "[KxngEcho][youtube]" to my loyle 
viewers and my goal is to reach 100k subscribers.
